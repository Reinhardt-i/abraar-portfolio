                Hi, I'm Abraar Masud Nafiz, a 23-year-old software engineer passionate about exploring the world of technology and its potential to transform lives. Currently studying at SUST, I am dedicated to honing my skills in software development and contributing to cutting-edge projects.

            <p>
                Python is my programming language of choice, and I love leveraging its versatility to create efficient and robust solutions. I am particularly interested in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and aspire to contribute to advancements in this exciting area of research.
